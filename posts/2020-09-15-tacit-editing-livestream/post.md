This month, Cedric is helping me level up my writing dojo. Every Thursday, we get on call and I watch as he edits my drafts, sentence after sentence. 

We do this so I can acquire the skills "[tacitly](https://commoncog.com/blog/the-tacit-knowledge-series/)," getting into his perspective and allowing the skill to be transferred by osmosis. 

We are planning to livestream our session this week, and will like to invite you to [join us](https://www.twitch.tv/jurvistan).
