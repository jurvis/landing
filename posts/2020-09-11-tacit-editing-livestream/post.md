This month, Cedric is helping me level up my writing dojo. Every Thursday, we get on call and I watch as he edits my drafts, sentence after sentence. We do this so I can acquire the skills "[tacitly](https://commoncog.com/blog/the-tacit-knowledge-series/)," by getting into his perspective and allowing the skill to be transferred by osmosis. 

We are planning to livestream one of these sessions one day, and will like to invite you to join us.
