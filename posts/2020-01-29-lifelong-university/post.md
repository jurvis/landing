Started as an innocent series of conversations I have had, Lifelong University started as an idea I distilled through my mediations and was originally published in [Apperceptive Mess #2](https://jurvis.substack.com/p/apperceptive-mess-2-opening-up-about), my weekly newsletter on what I have been spending my time thinking about throughout the week.

I have always been drawn to the Confucian idea of _lifelong learning_, some parts inspired by my Chinese upbringing, but many parts inspired by many successful people who have preached it's importance.

In my future writing on this blog, I will be telling stories of famous lifelong learners, their means of going about in engaging with the pursuit of wisdom and knowledge, and how we can use technology to usher a new generation of lifelong learners.

For now, please enjoy my brief write-up on how the Internet has brought us closer than ever to the initial aspiration of universities.

Universitas, the Latin word for University, is defined by Wikipedia as, ‚Äúthe whole, total, the universe, the world‚Äù.

In the twelfth century, when the earliest of universities started coming to existence within the world, a University did not exist as an entity that serves the same functions as a University typically does today. Universitas, as a university was usually referred to, was then only a self-governing guild of scholars/masters who congregated on a voluntary basis to prescribe studies to other members to pursue mastery over a given field.

Lacking any form of organised staff, universitas don‚Äôt own any physical property or buildings that you can mark physically as an institution of higher education.

While these attributes of a scholarly institution sounds like a far cry from what we are familiar with, it does sound a whole lot like a piece of technological innovation we use everyday but take for granted ‚Äî the internet.

The internet, like Universitas, looks nothing like a university of today. It lacks a physical presence, is unstructured, is mostly self-governing, memberships are acquired through signalling, and a natural order of guilds starts to form over deep-seated ideas that spark debates in a public square. In essence; we now live in a world where there is an open university for everybody.

The defining characteristic of the Internet has been the creation of an environment for businesses to reach the entire world at zero marginal costs ‚Äî where the cost to acquire an additional audience is near-zero.

This is true for information distribution as much as it is for information acquisition. University as an environment for learning and mastery doesn‚Äôt have to be a place defined by its geographical and physical presence; the spirit of universitas has permeated itself into our daily lives through the internet with our computers and phones, and transcends the dimensions of time and space that we traverse.

Universitas had a vision to facilitate conversation and capture mastery of ‚Äúthe whole, total, the universe, the world‚Äù. And for the first time, with the internet, we have found a suitable medium where this is possible ‚Äî to seek knowledge and greater understanding of the world regardless of where or how old you are.

What a time to be alive.
