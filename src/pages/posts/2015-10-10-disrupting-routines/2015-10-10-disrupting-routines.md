Tomorrow I'd be going mountain-biking with Paul (a really awesome colleague of mine) at Bukit Timah Nature Reserve. It's my first time doing mountain biking of any form so I think it'll be interesting.

It's been a long time since I've actually gone out of my way to learn and experience something new that challenges me mentally and physically so I'm genuinely excited. I've got this sudden renewed appetite for adventure and discovery - something I haven't really felt since I was 12.

It'll be fun. Will report back.
