Hi there! 

Wow. It has been a whole year since I've written on this blog. A lot has happened since. Here are some highlights:

1. Spent the whole of Q1 2021 in Singapore with family

2. Came back to the US in Q2 to enjoy what remains of our nomadic pandemic lifestyle touring national parks (we visited 8)

3. Went from totally worried that I have 0 acceptances to colleges I applied to, to getting into USC.

4. Moved into a new apartment in LA

5. Switched my major from Philosophy to Applied Math

I have never felt happier/more fulfilled with my intellectual pursuits. I've never always had the best relationship with my academics, but I finally found a healthy way to manage it.

Anyways, I think I'm going to start sharing more loose notes of what I'm working on these days. 

So excited for the future.
